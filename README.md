# Hi, I'm Logan
Currently this GitHub is looking a little bit empty. Most of my repositories are private due to being school projects or prototypes. Some of these include:
- Multiple Godot projects experimenting in both 2D and 3D, from basic Snake clones to destruction physics simulations
- Vue web apps
- General school programming projects, primarily written in Python and C++, including tests of various Algorithms
